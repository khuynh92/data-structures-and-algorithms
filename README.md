# data-structures-and-algorithms

## Reverse an Array
Reverse array method will take in an array in as an argument and return the array in reverse.

### Challenge
avoid using built in Javascript methods.

## Insert and shift middle index of array
Takes two arguments (an array and any value) and inserts the value to the middle index of the array. If the array length is odd, the middle index will round up

### Challenge
create a method that inserts a value to the middle of the array and shifts the rest of the values accordingly. Avoid using built in array prototype methods

## Binary Search
Takes two argumenets (a <b> sorted </b> array and a number(key)) and searches the array where the key and the index of the array match. The search will return the index of the array when found, if no matches are found, binary search will return -1.

### Challenge
create a method that searchs an array for the index where the array element matches the key. If no results found, return -1. Avoid using built in array prototype methods.

## Array Adjacent Products 
Take a 2-Dimensional array and locate the largest product of two adjacent values in the array. Adjacent values can be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 

### Challenge
create a method that takes in a 2-Dimensional array as an input and find the largest product of 2 adjacent values. Avoid using built in array prototype methods.

### Solution

## Linked List Insertions
Create  append, insertBefore, and insertAfter methods for a singly linked list.

### Challenge
.append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
.insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
.insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node
